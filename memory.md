# Memory

> This is the master memory file. Keep it indexed and durable. Do not load the whole file by default.

## How To Use This File

- Start in `CONTEXT.md`
- Read only the sections referenced there unless the task clearly requires more
- Record durable architecture decisions, environment notes, open work, and major change history here

## Memory Index

- Current priorities:
  - `## Current Direction`
  - `## Open Work`
- Repo conventions:
  - `## Repo Conventions`
- Environment and infra:
  - `## Environment Notes`
- Architecture:
  - `## Runtime Architecture`
  - `## Hermes Integration`
- Migration:
  - `## Migration Strategy`
- Recent work:
  - latest entry in `## Change Log`

## Current Direction

- Hermes is the control shell
- This repo is the deterministic runtime
- Generalist core comes before industry-specific packs
- Real estate is the first optimization target
- Marketing control plane is the first execution domain

## Repo Conventions

- `memory.md` is the master memory
- `CONTEXT.md` stays short and points into this file
- `WAT_Architecture.md` defines the operating model
- Keep hard guarantees in code, not in prompts

## Environment Notes

- Fresh Supabase project created for Hermes Central Command
- Local `.env` should be ported from the validated `Mailers AWF` environment as needed
- GitHub owner: `martinp09`
- Planned local path: `/Users/solomartin/Projects/Hermes Central Command`
- Trigger.dev CLI login is configured on this machine
- `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` is present in the local `.env`
- Trigger.dev local worker boot verified against project `proj_puouljyhwiraonjkpiki`

## Runtime Architecture

- FastAPI runtime for typed commands and policy
- Trigger.dev for durable jobs
- Supabase for canonical state and audit
- Hermes-facing tool/API surface

## Hermes Integration

- Hermes handles chat, approvals, coordination, and operator UX
- Hermes should not be treated as the source of truth
- Every Hermes action should map to a typed runtime command

## Migration Strategy

- Start fresh on new Supabase and new runtime repo
- Build marketing control plane first
- Defer seller-ops migration off `n8n` until runtime backbone exists

## Open Work

1. create runtime skeleton
2. establish clean migration baseline
3. implement control-plane schema and API
4. add Hermes-facing tool contract
5. add marketing workflow chain

## Change Log

### 2026-04-12 Repo Bootstrap

- Created the clean `Hermes Central Command` repo path
- Confirmed a fresh Supabase project is reachable
- Confirmed migration dry-run access works against the new project
- Ported WAT and memory/context operating conventions into the new repo
- Added Trigger.dev bootstrap files and verified `trigger:dev` reaches a ready local worker
- Added `CODEX.md` with subagent orchestration and cleanup rules
